          <p id=purpleText>A dream about purple is usually a symbol of mystery, good luck and power. Dreaming about purple things also symbolises that the dreamer will have physical or mental growth and development.<br>
          <br> A dream about wearing a purple dress is a good omen foretelling that the dreamer will have good luck. A dream about someone else wearing a purple dress betokens that disputes may happen in the family. <br>
          <br> If you see a long purple dress intended for a wedding, then this is a sign of a coming marriage with a person who occupies your thoughts and dreams. A short wedding dress of a similar color in a dream symbolizes unpleasant slander and vain accusations of treason. Most likely, the envy will spread gossip. <br>
          <br> Another interpretation is that a dream about a beautiful purple dress meant for social parties and balls indicates the dreamerâ€™s unwillingness to take any responsibility. </p>
