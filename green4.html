          <p id=greenText>In dreams, green signifies a positive change, good health, growth, fertility, healing, hope, vigor, vitality, peace, and serenity.<br>
          <br>The appearance of the color may also be a way of telling you to "go ahead".  Alternatively, green is a metaphor for a lack of experience in some task, while dark green indicates materialism, cheating, deceit, and/or difficulties with sharing.<br>
          <br>Green is also symbolic of your strive to gain recognition and establish your independence. Money, wealth and jealousy are often associated with this color.<br>
          <br>To dream of a green dress means that in the near future you will decide on some kind of adventure in reality. You will doubt whether to take the risk or not for a long time, but agreeing to take part in the endeavor, you will remain with a good advantage.<br>
          <br>For example, putting on an evening dress in shades of green predicts welfare and prosperity. A beautiful outfit in emerald colors foreshadows the justification of hope and fulfillment of desires. To sell a green dress is a dream is a symbol of reckless spending or loss of money. Sewing a long green dress for selling in a dream means that you will be offered a very promising position with a good income in reality. Buying a short green dress is a sign of an unfortunate misunderstanding and chagrin.</p>
